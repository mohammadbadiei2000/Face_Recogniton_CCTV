git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-cctv.git
cd face-recognition-cctv
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
python main.py

```

## 📊 Results

The model was evaluated on train, validation, and test splits.

| Dataset | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| Train    | 87.15%   |
| Validation | 87.31% |
| Test     | 86.36%   |

The small gap between training and validation accuracy indicates good generalization performance.
